# In-context learning vs. Fine-tuning

### In-context Learning

**How it works:** 
- In-context learning involves providing a language model with a few examples (prompts) and their corresponding outputs.
- The model learns to generalize from these examples and applies the learned patterns to new, unseen inputs.

**Key characteristics:**
- **No parameter updates:** The model's underlying parameters remain unchanged.
- **Flexibility:** Can adapt to new tasks without retraining.
- **Efficiency:** Requires less computational resources.

**Example:** 
- Providing a language model with a few examples of text summarization tasks, such as
- Input: A long article.
- Output: A concise summary." The model can then summarize other articles based on the provided examples.

### Fine-tuning

**How it works:** 
- Fine-tuning involves training a pre-trained language model on a specific dataset.
- This process adjusts the model's parameters to better fit the target task.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Parameter updates:** The model's parameters are modified to improve performance on the specific task.
- **Task-specific:** Tailored to a particular task or domain.
- **Potential for higher performance:** Can achieve higher accuracy and better results than in-context learning for specific tasks.

**Example:** 
- Training a language model on a large dataset of medical text to improve its ability to answer medical questions.

### Choosing the Right Approach
1. **Task complexity:** 
- For simple tasks, in-context learning may be sufficient. For more complex tasks, fine-tuning might be necessary.

2. **Data availability:** 
- If you have a large amount of labelled data, fine-tuning can be beneficial. If data is limited, in-context learning can be a good option.

3. **Computational resources:** 
- Fine-tuning requires more computational resources than in-context learning.

4. **Model flexibility:** 
- In-context learning offers more flexibility, as it doesn't require retraining the model for new tasks.
