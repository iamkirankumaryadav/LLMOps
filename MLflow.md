- Logs and records parameters, metrics, and artefacts during ML experiments.
- This helps in tracking and comparing different model versions.

### 2. **MLflow Projects:** 
- Packages ML code into reproducible units that can be shared and run on different environments.

### 3. **MLflow Models:** 
- Provides a standard format for packaging ML models, making it easy to deploy and serve them.

### 4. **MLflow Registry:** 
- A centralized repository for storing, versioning, and searching for ML models.

### **Benefits of using MLflow:**

1. **Reproducibility:** Ensures that experiments can be easily reproduced.
2. **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration among data scientists, ML engineers, and AI engineers.
3. **Scalability:** Can handle large-scale ML projects.
4. **Flexibility:** Supports a variety of ML frameworks and deployment targets.
